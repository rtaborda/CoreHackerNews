# CoreHackerNews

## Assumptions
Given the sentence _The API should return an array of the first 20 "best stories" as returned by the Hacker News API, sorted by their score in a descending order._
I assumed that I didn't need to filter out the items that have `Dead` and `Deleted` as `true`.

I also assumed that the endpoint https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/beststories.json only returns items with `"type": "story"`.

## Improvements
The main improvement I would do would be to use a proper distributed cache like Redis, instead of the built in IMemoryCache.
Some other small improvements that could be made would be to improve the swagger generated documentation and using Serilog instead of the default Microsoft logging.
